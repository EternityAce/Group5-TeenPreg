									<p>Teenage pregnancy is when a woman under 20 gets pregnant. It usually refers to teens between the ages of 15-19. 
										But it can include girls as young as 10. It's also called teen pregnancy or adolescent pregnancy.</p>
									<p>Teenage pregnancy is a global health issue, causing complications and death rates higher than older women. Physically less developed teens are particularly vulnerable, potentially leading to intergenerational poverty and ill-health.</p>
									<p>Teenage pregnancy has been recently alarming because of the increasing rates around the world. In this blog, we will be presenting and showing you what are the causes, challenges, risks and how to avoid and deal with this situation.

										The adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes can be ameliorated through antenatal and postnatal care that attends to the special needs of this group.</p>

							<br>
							<h4>Get regular prenatal care</h4>

							<h4>Find parenting classes</h4>
								<p> - It's a good idea to start classes during pregnancy so your child can learn how to take care of a baby before it arrives. Getting educated will also help your child manage the transition to parenthood more smoothly. And because parent-child interactions are so important, especially during the first three years, keeping up these classes benefits everyone.</p>
							<h4>Prioritize school</h4>
